If the `smsProvidersFallbackChain` list is empty, an SMS or voice message will be sent using the default Ping Twilio account. Otherwise, an SMS or voice message will be sent using the first provider in the list.

This process will go on until there are no more providers in the list. If the server failed to send the message using all providers, the notification status is set to `FAILED`.

            `SHORT_CODE`: A collection containing a single 2-character ISO country code, for example, `US`, `GB`, `CA`.
            If the custom provider is of `type=CUSTOM_PROVIDER`, `supportedCountries` must not be empty or null.
            For other custom provider types, if `supportedCountries` is null (empty is not supported), the specified short code number can only be used to dispatch notifications to United States recipient numbers.
            `TOLL_FREE`: A collection of valid 2-character country ISO codes, for example, `US`, `GB`, `CA`.
            If the custom provider is of `type=CUSTOM_PROVIDER`, `supportedCountries` must not be empty or null.
            For other custom provider types, if `supportedCountries` is null (empty is not supported), the specified toll-free number can only be used to dispatch notifications to United States recipient numbers.
            `PHONE_NUMBER`: `supportedCountries` can not be specified.
            If an SMS template has an alphanumeric `sender` ID and also has short code, the `sender` ID will be used for destination countries that support both alphanumeric senders and short codes. For Unites States and Canada that don't support alphanumeric sender IDs, a short code will be used if both an alphanumeric sender and a short code are specified.

If both of these conditions are true, then the user is sent to the identity provider with a login hint equal to their externalId for the identity provider (saved on the account link). If these conditions are not true, then the API checks see if there is an OIDC login hint on the flow. If so, that login hint is used. If none of these conditions are true, the login hint parameter is not included on the authorization request to the identity provider.

                The voice text.  Limited to 1Kb characters.
                  The following substitution place holders can be embedded in the message:
                  * `<pause1sec>`: Pauses the message narration for 1 second.
                    The pause interval <pause1sec> cannot be modified. To pause the message narration for more than one second, repeat multiple `<pause1sec>` occurrences in succession, according to the desired pause interval duration. For example, `<pause1sec><pause1sec><pause1sec>` pauses the message narration for three seconds.
                  * `<sayCharValue> .. </sayCharValue>`: Reads the character name of each character of the enclosed string separately.
                  * `<repeatMessage val=x> .. </repeatMessage>`: Narrates the enclosed text `<val>` number of times.
                  
                  In the following message example, `${otp}` is assigned the value `"123456"`, and `${email}` is assigned the value `"joe@bxz.com"`:
                  ```
                  Hello <pause1sec> your authentication code is 
                  <sayCharValue>${otp}</​sayCharValue> 
                  <repeatMessage val=2> I repeat your code is 
                  <sayCharValue>${otp}</​sayCharValue>
                  </​repeatMessage> <pause1sec> 
                  Mail <sayCharValue>${email}</​sayCharValue> for help
                  ```
                  The narrated message on the voice call sounds like:
                  ```
                  HELLO <1 second silence> YOUR AUTHENTICATION CODE IS
