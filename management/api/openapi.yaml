            If the custom provider is of `type=CUSTOM_PROVIDER`, `supportedCountries` must not be empty or null.
            For other custom provider types, if `supportedCountries` is null (empty is not supported), the specified short code number can only be used to dispatch notifications to United States recipient numbers.
            `TOLL_FREE`: A collection of valid 2-character country ISO codes, for example, `US`, `GB`, `CA`.
            If the custom provider is of `type=CUSTOM_PROVIDER`, `supportedCountries` must not be empty or null.
            For other custom provider types, if `supportedCountries` is null (empty is not supported), the specified toll-free number can only be used to dispatch notifications to United States recipient numbers.
            `PHONE_NUMBER`: `supportedCountries` can not be specified.
            If an SMS template has an alphanumeric `sender` ID and also has short code, the `sender` ID will be used for destination countries that support both alphanumeric senders and short codes. For Unites States and Canada that don't support alphanumeric sender IDs, a short code will be used if both an alphanumeric sender and a short code are specified.
