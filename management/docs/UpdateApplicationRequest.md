If you set the loginPageUrl property for applications in an environment that sets a custom domain, the URL should include the top-level domain and at least one additional domain level. Warning To avoid issues with third-party cookies in some browsers, a custom domain must be used, giving your PingOne environment the same parent domain as your authentication application. For more information about custom domains, see Custom domains. | [optional]

Although both of these parameters are generally URLs, because they are used as deep links, this is not enforced. If neither defaultTargetUrl nor applicationUrl is specified during a SAML authentication flow, no RelayState value is supplied to the application. The defaultTargetUrl (or the applicationUrl) value is passed to the SAML application&#39;s ACS URL as a separate RelayState key value (not within the SAMLResponse key value). | [optional]

**SloWindow** | Pointer to **int32** | Defines how long PingOne can exchange logout messages with the application, specifically a &#x60;LogoutRequest&#x60; from the application, since the initial request. PingOne can also send a &#x60;LogoutRequest&#x60; to the application when a single logout is initiated by the user from other session participants, such as an application or identity provider. This setting is per application. The SLO logout is separate from the user session logout that revokes all tokens. | [optional]
