      description:  >-
        An enum indicating the source used to calculate the threshold. This can be
        `MIN_NOT_REACHED`. If the measure is less than `every.minSample`, the threshold isn't calculated. Instead, a value of `LOW` is automatically assigned. If less than five IPs were used by the user during the past hour, `MIN_NOT_REACHED` is set.
        `CALCULATED`. Indicates the threshold is guaranteed to be calculated.
        `ENVIRONMENT_FALLBACK`. Indicates a global threshold calculated for the entire environment is used. The global threshold is used when the `ipVelocityByUser.threshold` couldn't be calculated, generally due to a lack of past transactions for the risk predictor to use for the threshold calculation.
        `DEFAULT_FALLBACK`. Indicates the default threshold defined for the predictor (in `threshold.medium` or `threshold.high`) is used. The default threshold is used when `ENVIRONMENT_FALLBACK` (the global threshold) couldn't be calculated, generally due to a lack of past transactions for the risk predictor to use for the environment threshold calculation.
