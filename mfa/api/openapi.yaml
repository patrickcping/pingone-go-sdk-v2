For example, `{"name": “name”, “subAttributes”:[{“name”: “given”}, {“name”: “family”}]}, {"name": "email"}` or `{"name": “name”, “subAttributes”:[{“name”: “formatted”}]}, {"name": "email"}`.
            - The content of the list should reflect the preferred order.
            - If the first attribute is empty for the user, PingOne will continue through the list until a non-empty attribute is found.
            - You can specify any user attribute (including custom attributes) that meet the following criteria: attribute type must be String, validation cannot be set to enumerated values.
            - The array must contain the user attribute "username" - to ensure that there is at least one non-empty attribute.
            - You can have a maximum of six user attributes in the list.
