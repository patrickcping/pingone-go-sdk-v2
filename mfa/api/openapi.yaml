If you want to use the "name" attribute for the user, you must also specify the "subAttributes", which can be either the "given" and "family" user attributes or the "formatted" user attribute. For example, `{"name": “name”, “subAttributes”:[{“name”: “given”}, {“name”: “family”}]}, {"name": "email"}` or `{"name": “name”, “subAttributes”:[{“name”: “formatted”}]}, {"name": "email"}`.
            - The content of the list should reflect the preferred order.
            - If the first attribute is empty for the user, PingOne will continue through the list until a non-empty attribute is found.
            - You can specify any user attribute (including custom attributes) that meet the following criteria: attribute type must be String, validation cannot be set to enumerated values.
            - The array must contain the user attribute "username" - to ensure that there is at least one non-empty attribute.
            - You can have a maximum of six user attributes in the list.
