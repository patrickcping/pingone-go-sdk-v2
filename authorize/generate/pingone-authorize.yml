For any type, the pattern can contain characters that are otherwise invalid in a URL path. Invalid characters are handled by performing matching against a percent-decoded HTTP request target path. This allows an administrator to configure patterns without worrying about percent encoding special characters.
                  When the `type` is `PARAMETER`, the syntax outlined in the table below is enforced. Additionally, the pattern must contain a wildcard, double wildcard or named parameter. When the `type` is `EXACT`, the pattern can be any byte sequence except for ASCII control characters such as line feeds or carriage returns. The length of the pattern cannot exceed 2048 characters. The path pattern must not contain empty path segments such as `/../`, `//`, and `/./`.
